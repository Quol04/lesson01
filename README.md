## Development Guidelines

### This is being used for teaching and Testing

1. Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for JS, kebab-case for CSS)

2. Maintain modular and reusable components

3. Prefer functional components and hooks (if using React)

4. Write a responsive, accessible UI

5. Separate concerns: logic in hooks/services, UI in components

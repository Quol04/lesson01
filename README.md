## New Repository
This is for testing code
## Will also be used for teaching
## Development Guidelines
Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for JS, kebab-case for CSS)

Maintain modular and reusable components

Prefer functional components and hooks (if using React)

Write responsive, accessible UI

Separate concerns: logic in hooks/services, UI in components
